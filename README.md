# Graphic

A simple, compact and high quality seven band graphic equaliser for Eurorack. Inspired by the Boss GE-7 pedal, but with pristine low-noise circuitry and a much broader frequency range. Simple (if repetitive) SMD soldering with human-sized components. 

Bolder DIYers can easily modify the frequency bands by swapping resistors and capacitors. 

The 5 x N5532 chips draw 7.8ma each (which is in line with the datasheet), and get quite warm, which seems not abnormal for this chip = 39ma - you can feel the warmth on the panel! 

With 2k resistors, the 7xLEDs draw  about 38ma making a total of 77ma, which seems quite high compared with simpler circuits using a couple of low-draw Op Amps like the TL072. This circuit will probably work fine with TL072, which would use 14ma (making a total of 52ma) but risks being more noisy. (Now I understand why battery-powered stompboxes like the GE-7 are designed in a way that leaves them rather noisy... )

The PCB panel includes two holes for M2 x 6mm bolts (48SM006) to make the constuction stronger. Place a 3mm spacer between the panel and the slider. 

This m2 x 2.9mm spacer should work: 710-9774015243R, and thisthis M2.5 x 3mm 761-M0502-25-AL should also work OK.
