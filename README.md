# Graphic

A simple, compact and high quality seven band graphic equaliser for Eurorack. Inspired by the Boss GE-7 pedal, but with pristine low-noise circuitry and a much broader frequency range. Simple (if repetitive) SMD soldering with human-sized components. 

Bolder DIYers can easily modify the frequency bands by swapping resistors and capacitors. 

The PCB panel includes two holes for M2 x 6mm bolts to make the constuction stronger. Place a 3mm spacer between the panel and the slider.
